# TestSuitePowershell

Method to run Business Central Test Suites from PowerShell.
To use this, you have to publish the provided Codeunit as a web service (SOAP).

In case you get connection timeouts while the test suite runs you have to increase the timeout value for SOAP on Service Tier level.

Take care of the variables in the PowerShell scripts.
